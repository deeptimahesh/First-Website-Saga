<h1> WHAT SORCERY HAVE I ACCOMPLISHED? </h1>

<p> Let it be known, that I'm an advocate of the ban-all-white-chocolate revolution. I tried to spearhead the campaign but ultimately forgot to print enough pamphlets. <p>
<ul>
<li> I can cook thirty minute recipes in twenty minutes. Critics worldwide have shed tears because of the delectable taste of my chocolate milkshake recipe.</li>
<li> I can throw chalks with deadly accuracy. THe laws of physics do not apply to me.</li>
<li> I've managed to survive seventeen long years with no talent to speak of whatsoever.</li>
<li> Sometimes, I think I'd be better off as a Pokemon. Striking people with a lightning bolt seems theraupatic.</li>
<li> In 2012, Psy asked me to choreograph a move for his music video Gangnam Style.</li>
<li> Just three weeks back, I became the first person to climb Everest in a spacesuit.</li>
<li> Last year, I listened to a Tibetean monk tell me the meaning of life but I couldn't write it down becuase he didn't hae a pen.</li>
<li> I visit the penguins down South, occasionally because the way they waddle amuse me. I even adopted a few. </li>
